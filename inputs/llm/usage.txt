Discussion (New Paper Draft)

Detailed findings

Based on the primary work of Feldman et al. (2017), the original paper demonstrates that a strong belief in free will results in significant increases in job satisfaction; this correlation is relevant across cultural differences and in different work fields (e.g., from Taiwanese real estate agents to American digital Labor) similar results were maintained.

Through this paper, we conducted a secondary survey of institutional beliefs in the digital gig economy (specifically the MTurk community) and sought to determine whether there is a positive relationship between U.S. workersâ€™ beliefs about free will and their job satisfaction with Amazon Mechanical. Based on an analysis of information from a six-month focused study of Amazon MTurk workers presented in the original paper, our results confirm a positive relationship, indicating that workers with a stronger belief in free will tend to report higher levels of job satisfaction. Our analysis shows that the correlation between free will beliefs and job satisfaction is more vital in this digital microtask environment than in a traditional work environment. The above reinforces the idea that institutional beliefs in the increasingly prevalent gig economy are not just philosophical abstractions but have real consequences for workforce well-being.

Theoretical Implications

The findings from our study offer theoretical implications for understanding job satisfaction in the context of the gig economy. Specifically, they suggest that beliefs in free will play a crucial role in shaping workers' perceptions of their autonomy and, consequently, their job satisfaction. This challenges and extends traditional theories of job satisfaction by incorporating the psychological dimension of free will beliefs, especially in flexible work environments like MTurk. It invites a reevaluation of how autonomy is conceptualized and valued in non-traditional work settings, advocating for a broader understanding of factors contributing to job satisfaction. The result is it highlights the importance of creating an environment that enhances employee autonomy, potentially increasing employee engagement and satisfaction.

Journal Study: Work and Freedom in the Context of Agency Beliefs and Job Satisfaction

To further confirm the validity of the original paper and our analysis, we selected another peer-reviewed professional academic journal for reference. By analyzing the comprehensive study conducted by Baldissarri et al. (2017) explored the complex relationship between work activities that trigger self-objectification and subsequent beliefs in personal free will. Through a series of methodologically rigorous studies, this research illustrates that diminished free will beliefs are a result of engaging in repetitive, fragmented, and externally directed tasks. This reduction in belief in free will, mediated by self-objectification, sets up a subtle interplay between the nature of work and the psychological makeup of the worker. Consistent with Feldman et al. Baldissarri et al. (2017) established a link between free will beliefs and job satisfaction. Further emphasis is placed on the complexity of agency within the professional realm.

Our findings suggest that MTurk employees who perceive greater autonomy and personal agency report greater job satisfaction, which resonates with the implications of the work of Baldissarri et al. Routine and piecemeal tasks on MTurk can lead to some form of self-objectification, potentially undermining belief in individual free will and, in turn, job satisfaction. Therefore, the inherent structure of gig work may require strategies that enhance perceptions of free will and personal agency in order to increase job satisfaction.

Ethical Considerations in Long-Term Behavioural Studies

Ethical considerations are crucial in long-term behavioural research, especially when studying beliefs and job satisfaction. In doing so, we focused on the research methods and ethical concerns of the original academic journal Feldman et al. (2017). Feldman et al. took a series of steps to ensure the ethics of the study, including ensuring informed consent, protecting privacy and data security, and providing long-term participant support and opportunities for explanation.

We agree with the above ethically appropriate measures of the original academic journal and believe that the research paid special attention to avoiding any possible adverse psychological effects and ensured that all research standards were met through ethical oversight by the institutional review board. This approach ensures maximum protection of participant well-being during the research process and reinforces our commitment to ethical standards while also improving research quality and participant trust in the research.

Accounting for Bias

In addressing bias within the discussion section of our paper, it's essential to acknowledge that while our study expands on the foundational research by Feldman et al. (2017) in exploring the impact of free will beliefs on job satisfaction, particularly within the digital gig economy of Amazon Mechanical Turk, inherent biases in data collection and analysis could influence the outcomes. Ethical implications and biases naturally emerge in both quantitative and qualitative research. For instance, sampling bias can occur when the study participants are not representative of the broader population intended to be analyzed. This type of bias might be mitigated through strategies such as simple random sampling, ensuring that every individual within the target population has an equal chance of selection. However, challenges such as self-selection bias, where individuals with a strong interest in the topic may be more likely to participate, can skew results. Despite efforts to create a representative sample through demographic balancing, such biases may persist, potentially limiting the generalizability of the findings. Thus, acknowledging these limitations and adopting rigorous methodological safeguards are crucial for enhancing the credibility and applicability of research conclusions.

Analytical Limitations and Future Research Pathways

While our study sheds light on the relationship between free will beliefs and job satisfaction in the context of MTurk, it also highlights several limitations. The unique demographics of MTurk workers and the platform's specific work conditions may not fully extrapolate to the broader gig economy. For instance, platforms like MTurk offer a degree of autonomy by allowing workers to choose tasks; however, this freedom is within the confines of predetermined task parameters and compensation set by the platform. Future research should explore this relationship across diverse gig platforms and investigate the longitudinal effects of free will beliefs on job satisfaction to establish causality. Additionally, examining the interplay between personal autonomy and platform policies could offer insights into optimizing job satisfaction in gig work.

Concluding Observations

Overall, our study sought to determine whether a positive correlation exists between American workers' beliefs in free will and their job satisfaction on Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk). Our results confirmed a positive relationship, indicating that workers with stronger beliefs in free will tend to report higher levels of job satisfaction. This finding is supported by data analysis showing that perceived autonomy, a critical aspect of free will, significantly contributes to this increased satisfaction. These insights validate our hypothesis and highlight the importance of fostering an environment that supports autonomy and personal agency in gig economy platforms like MTurk.
